# EE89

A optional honors seminar held in conjunction with EE M16: Logic Design of Digital Systems, taught by Professor Mehta. In this class,  we implemented a Morse code decoder with the Basys 3 FPGA board.

If you for some reason have a Basys 3 FPGA board handy and wish to see the code in action, go [here](https://github.com/ayemetoo/EE89/tree/master/Part%202/ShiftingMorse) for the final implementation of the project, which takes in morse input and decodes it, displaying up to four letters of the decoded morse at a time.
